## Exercise - LocalizedError
 
 A better approach to the previous exercise might be using the LocalizedError protocol, so that the printed output of each error is contained in a `errorDescription` property. Using the error messages you created in the last step, change `CommunicationError` to conform to `LocalizedError`. Add an `errorDescription` computed String property, switching on self to return the appropriate message.

    case unknown
    
    var errorDescription: String? {
        switch self {
        case .networkServiceUnavailable:
            return "Network Service is unavailable."

            return "Invalid message: \(message)."

        case .rejectedByServer(let reason):

        case .unknown:

 Now, use only one catch block below to catch all errors, printing the error's `errorDescription` to the console. Test your code several times.
