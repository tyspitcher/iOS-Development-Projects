## Exercise - Variables
 
 Declare a variable `schooling` and set it to the number of years of school that you have completed. Print `schooling` to the console.

//:  Now imagine you just completed an additional year of school, and update the `schooling` variable accordingly. Print `schooling` to the console.
schooling = 17
print(schooling)
//:  Does the above code compile? Why is this different than trying to update a constant? Print your explanation to the console using the `print` function.
print("The value can now change because I'm using they type var which creates a variable, instead of let which makes a constant.")
